# Nonparametric Relative Entropy

## Case 1

Run the script `Case1Repeat.m` to generate the results of Nonparametric relative Entropy for Case 1. The results are saved in the file `Case1ParforRep.mat`. **Note**: I run this scripts parallel on High Performance Server to reduce the time of computation.

Similarly, run the script `Case1Other.m` to generate the results of Approximate entropy (ApEn), mean and variance respectively. The results are saved in the file `Case1Other.mat`.

## Case 2

Run the script `Case2All.m` to generate the results of Case 2. The results are saved in the file `Case2ParforRep.mat`. **Note**: I run this scripts parallel on High Performance Server to reduce the time of computation.

## Case 3

Run the script `Case3All.m` to generate the results of Case 3. The results are saved in the file `Case3ParforRep.mat`. **Note**: I run this scripts parallel on High Performance Server to reduce the time of computation.
